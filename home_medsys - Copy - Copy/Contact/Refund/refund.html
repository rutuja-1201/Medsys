                <h3> Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>
                     We thank you and appreciate your service or product purchase with us on our website
                    www.medsysconsultancy.com (hereinafter referred to as “Medsys Consultancy”). Please read this policy
                    and the Medsys Consultancy terms and conditions carefully as they will give you important
                    information and guidelines about your rights and obligations as our customer, with respect to any
                    purchase or service we provide to you.

               <p>
                         We make every effort to provide the service to you as per the specifications and timelines
                        mentioned against each service or product purchased by you from Medsys Consultancy, however, if
                        due to any reason, we are unable to provide to you the service or product you purchased from us,
                        then you shall be entitled to a refund which shall be subject on the following situations:

               </p>

               <p>
                The Refund shall be only considered in the event there is a clear, visible deficiency with the
                service or product purchased from Medsys Consultancy.
               </p>
                       
               
               <p>
                In the event a customer has paid for a service and then requests for a refund only because there
                was a change in mind, the refund shall not be considered as there is no fault, defect, or onus
                on Medsys Consultancy.
                Refund requests shall not be entertained after the work has been shared with you in the event
                of a change of mind. However, we shall give you the option of using the amount paid for by you,
                for an alternative service in Medsys Consultancy amounting to the same value and the said amount
                could be applied in part or whole towards the said new service; 
               </p>
                        
                      <p>
                        If the request for a refund has been raised 30 (thirty) days after the purchase of a service or
                        product has been completed and the same has been intimated and indicated via email or through
                        any form of communication stating that the work has been completed, then, such refund request
                        shall be deemed invalid and shall not be considered.
                      </p>
                      
            

                   <p>
                    If the request for the refund has been approved by Medsys Consultancy, the same shall be
                    processed and intimated to you via email. This refund process could take a minimum of 15
                    (fifteen) business days to process and shall be credited to your bank account accordingly. We
                    shall handle the refund process with care and ensure that the money spent by you is returned to
                    you at the earliest.
                   </p>
