                    <p>India currently houses the world’s third-largest start-up ecosystem, with over 50 firms being valued at over USD 1 billion, or what is known as Unicorns. From e-commerce to electric vehicles, the Indian start-ups are the torchbearer for the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit of India. The start-up ecosystem continues to contribute to the digitization of India and create employment and wealth across various segments of society. The cycle of innovation is speeding up, and talented entrepreneurs are ready to take over and invent the next disruptive technologies.

                        The Medsys Consultancy Service, a Private Enterprise, understands the importance of entrepreneurs working to transform new ideas into thriving companies. Founders face considerable challenges as they work to bring new ideas to the marketplace while taking incremental leadership responsibilities. Raising capital, finding talent, acquiring customers, complying with regulatory requirements, and other management initiatives take time and are important to maximize business success. We are delighted to share highlights from our experience in this guide including operational, financial, tax, accounting matters, and other business considerations. Currently, we have been committed to serving start-up companies across India and hope to be a useful and insightful guide in their journey. We welcome you to know us better and look forward to the opportunity to assist in your business strategies.
